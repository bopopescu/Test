Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data.
While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable.
opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly.
Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large
volumes of information.
